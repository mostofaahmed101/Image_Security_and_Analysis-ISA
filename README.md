## 🖼️ About the Project

**Image Security & Analysis (ISA)** is a GUI-based Python application that allows users to:

- Securely login and manage user credentials.
- Encrypt and decrypt images to protect sensitive visual data.
- Hide and retrieve secret text inside images using steganography.
- Analyze digital images for metadata and forensic evidence.
- Keep a full history of image operations performed.

This project is focused on **digital image security**, providing tools typically used in digital forensics and private communications, all in one simple, user-friendly interface.

## 🛡️ Security Highlights

- Passwords are securely hashed before storing.
- Encrypted images are unreadable without the correct key.
- Steganography uses LSB method to embed secret messages invisibly.
- Logs are maintained for user action traceability.
- Designed with a security-first mindset.
